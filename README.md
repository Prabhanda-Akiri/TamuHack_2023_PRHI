## Inspiration
Being a first-hand witness to the medical process and interacting with hospital staff, there is a huge scope for confusion while giving medicinal dosages, especially in acute ailment cases. The purpose of this app is to reduce the risk to patients' lives that may happen due to incorrect dosages.

## What it does
There is a huge chance of human error that may happen while giving medicinal dosages to patients like over-dosing, under-dosing, and wrong medication. This app minimizes human errors by keeping track of dosages and synchronizing the medicinal dosage requirements between nurses and patient attendants.

## How we built it
This is an end-to-end web app built using PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Challenges we ran into
we ran into some technical challenges while setting up the database. we have managed to resolve it by synchronizing the huge amount of data using primary keys and correlating various tables.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
we are proud of coming up with this idea and developing a viable product integration front end and back end in a very short span of time.

## What we learned
We learned to work in an agile manner, splitting up the tasks among our team members and even catching up with some new technologies. 

## What's next for INPATCare
we plan to extend some important features of this project in the future. We can extend this to support different devices(Desktops, Tabs, Android, etc) which notify the users by sending In-app Notifications or email triggers.
